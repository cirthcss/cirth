# Get Started

Cirth styles standard HTML elements first. Load one stylesheet, write ordinary
semantic markup, and most of your interface is already styled.

## CDN

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cirthcss/cirth@0.3.0/dist/cirth.min.css">
```

## npm

```sh
npm install @cirthcss/cirth
```

```js
import "@cirthcss/cirth/dist/cirth.min.css";
```

Every published build also has a shorter `exports` path, for example
`@cirthcss/cirth/jade`, `@cirthcss/cirth/classless`, or
`@cirthcss/cirth/jade/classless/scoped` — see
[Build tooling](/build-tooling#package-exports) for the full map. The
`dist/*.css` paths keep working alongside them.

The package ships compiled CSS only — `main`/`style` both point at
`dist/cirth.min.css`. SCSS sources in the repository are internal build
infrastructure, not a published Sass API.

## Quickstart

<Demo src="quickstart" />

No classes were added above beyond `.container` — `<nav>`, `<article>`,
`<form>`, `<label>`, and `<button>` are styled directly.

## Which build do I need?

Cirth publishes four CSS builds from the same source:

| File | Use it when… |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/cirth.min.css` | Default. You write normal HTML and want `.container`, `.grid`, `.secondary`/`.outline` modifiers, dropdowns, etc. |
| `dist/cirth.classless.min.css` | You want the smallest possible markup: no classes at all, styled through `body > header/main/footer`. |
| `dist/cirth.scoped.min.css` | You're embedding Cirth into an existing page, CMS, or app shell and only want elements inside a `.cirth` wrapper affected. |
| `dist/cirth.classless.scoped.min.css` | Both: scoped **and** classless. |

Every color theme (see [Colors](/colors)) — azure (default), jade, and slate —
is published in all four variants, for example `dist/cirth.jade.min.css` or
`dist/cirth.classless.scoped.slate.min.css`.

### Classless

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/cirth.classless.min.css">
```

<Demo src="classless" variant="classless" />

### Scoped

Useful when embedding Cirth into an existing page, CMS, widget, or app shell —
only descendants of `.cirth` are styled.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/cirth.scoped.min.css">

<div class="cirth">
  <article>
    <h3>Embedded widget</h3>
    <button type="button">Save</button>
  </article>
</div>
```

<Demo src="scoped" />

This documentation site is itself styled by Cirth's default build — the
header nav, the sidebar, the prose you're reading, and every live example
are ordinary semantic HTML with no docs-specific component framework on
top.

## Next steps

- [Customization](/customization) — override the CSS custom property surface.
- [Colors](/colors) — pick one of the three maintained themes.
- [Layout](/layout/document) — start reading the component reference.
